title = "Flintstone Family Members"

p title.center(40)

=begin

This program will output "       Flintstone Family Members        ". This program demonstrates the use of the center method to center a string within a given width for the string. It's important to note that this method is non destructive and returns a new string without modifying the original string, which is why it was necessary to call p on the return value of title.center(40).

=end
