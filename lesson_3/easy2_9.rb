statement = "The Flintstones Rock!"

p statement.count('t')

=begin

This program will output 2. This program demonstrates the use of the count method, which returns the number of instances of a certain character or a set of characters (in the form of a string argument) in the calling string. In this case, the statement string has two instances of the character 't', so statement.count('t') returns 2.
